## Vectorlink: The Ultimate Vectrex Controller System

Vectorlink is a joystick adapter designed by Brett Walach of PlayVectrex.com in 2021 that allows many different types of high quality off-the-shelf wireless or wired controllers to be used with the Vectrex. It consists of a base adapter that has a connector that is the same one found on a Nintendo WiiMote. This enables the Vectorlink to connect to countless controllers out there. It was primarily designed to work with the 8BitDo SNES/NES Classic Bluetooth Retro Receiver (aka BT Dongle) and the 8BitDo Arcade Stick, but as you’ll read it works with so much more!

Hardware and software for Vectorlink will be open sourced here after it’s time to move on to a new project. In fact, the PCBs already have the URL on them for this repo.
